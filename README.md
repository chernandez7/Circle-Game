Find the Circle Game
	
Description:
	
	The game creates a 400x400 window and randomly generates a circle
	anywhere on the page. Your goal is to find this circle.

	Click in the window until you find the circle. You have
	a limited number of tries to find the cirlce, and the radius/clicks
	vary by level. For example, level 1 has a larger radius and a greater
	number of tries to find the circle than do levels 2, 3, etc...

Steps:
	1. Select level difficulty - Level 1 is the easiest, with level 4 being 
	the hardest (small radius and fewer number of tries to win)
	2. To play the game, click anywhere inside the game window to try to
	find the circle.
	3.To win, you must click inside the radius of the circle before your
	number of clicks run out. If your clicks run out before clicking 
	inside the radius, the screen will display "You lose."If you win, it
	will display "You win!" Congratulations. If you win or lose,
	you will be promoted to try again with the "Replay?" button.
